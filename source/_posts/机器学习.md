# Overview
## Definition
Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
## Machine learning algorithms
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning 
- Recommender systems
- Reinforcement learning
### Supervised Learning
- Regression
- Classification
Key charateristic:input-->output
**Regression**:Predicts a number from infinitely many possible numbers.
**Classification**:Predicts catagories from small number of possible outputs.Categories don't have to be numbers.
When it comes to two or more inputs:The learning algorithm has to decide how to fit a boundary line to this data.
### Unsupervised learning
Find something interesting in unlabeld data.
Key charateristc:Data only comes with inputs x,but not output labels y.Algorithm has to find structure in the data.
- Clustering
- Anomaly detection
- Dimensionality reduction
**Clustering**: Places the unlabeled data into different clusters,automatically finding stucture into data and figuring out what are the major types of individuals.
**Anomaly detection**:Finds unusual data points.
**Dimensionality reduction**ï¼šCompress data using fewer numbers.
